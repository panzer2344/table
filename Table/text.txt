Hobbes begins his treatise on politics with an account of human nature 
He presents an image of man as matter in motion attempting to show through 
example how everything about humanity can be explained materialistically 
that is without recourse to an incorporeal immaterial soul or a faculty 
for understanding ideas that are external to the human mind Hobbes proceeds 
by defining terms clearly and unsentimentally Good and evil are nothing more 
than terms used to denote an individual's appetites and desires while these 
appetites and desires are nothing more than the tendency to move toward or 
away from an object Hope is nothing more than an appetite for a thing combined 
with opinion that it can be had He suggests the dominant political theology of 
the time Scholasticism thrives on confused definitions of everyday words such as 
incorporeal substance which for Hobbes is a contradiction in terms
